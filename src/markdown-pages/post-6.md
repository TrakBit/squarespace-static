### Let's Learn how to grow and monetise your Squarespace site with its <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/ecommerce/membership-sites" target="_blank">membership</a> feature. Let's understand what goes behind the subscription paywall and what doesn't.

## Not everything goes behind the paywall (Freemium Model)
As <a href="https://github.com/trakbit" target="_blank">someone</a> who has built multiple subscription products I would strongly recommend not to put all your content behind a paywall. Why ? Cause users need to know first **is your product worth paying?** The susbcription wall should be placed in front of the most important content/business value.

Have the freemium content to market your squarespace site and the premium content to monetise your site. Do **ensure you aren't giving too less or too much** in your freemium part. Giving too less will prevent from bringing users but giving too much will not encourage users to go for the premium. You might not able to know the positioning of paywall in one shot so be willing to readjust it.

## Make the membership worth paying (Value for Money)
For one time sale you need to give customers one time business value but for subscription/membership model you need to **give customers recurring business value**. If there isn't a true need for customer to revisit your site its unlikely to lead to subscription model. So what can one do make the subscription worthy ?
- **Write consistent content -** Don't give out all your content at once. Break it down in chunks and release it with your subscription cycle (weekly, monthly).
- **Give support -** Can be expensive and time consuming task so why not bundle it with your subscription service and make it exclusively for your paid users. (eg. - You can use <a href="https://salesjump.xyz/" target="_blank"> **salesjump**</a> to add whatsapp chat widget to your pages which are behind the paywall.)

## Not every visitor will become customer (Conversion rates)
Every user that will visit your squarespace membership site is not going to pay and that's more than okay. You just need to **focus on building the content funnel** and let the conversion rate filter the customers from the visitors for you.

See the membership model like a leaky bucket, where you as a business owner need to focus on only two factors to keep enough water in the bucket or users in membership -

- Sufficient flow of water/users from the tap by routinely doing <a href="https://salesjump.xyz/blog/squarespace-seo-guide" target="_blank"> **SEO**</a>.
- Reduce the leakage from the bucket/membership by giving high quality content and <a href="https://salesjump.xyz/" target="_blank"> **listening frequently**</a> to your users need.

## Membership model is worth trying (Iterate and Test)
There is no denying that membership model is hard to monetise but would strongly recommend to try opting it. Why ? It gives you a steady stream of income thus creating an asset on which you can rely on. Do not expect to have it all perefectly tuned for customers need, you're very likely to have the need to readjust it to eventually make it suitable for much larger audience.
