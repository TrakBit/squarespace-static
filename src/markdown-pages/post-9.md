Squarespace <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/ecommerce/membership-sites" target="_blank">Member Areas</a> is seamless solution to create membership sites. But I felt the pricing is a bit too expensive cause if you need **multiple pricing tier or more than one member area** you need to upgrade your plan from $10 to $20 🙁.
