## The Good
Despite the ease of use you still get to control
- How much to charge

Squarespace <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/ecommerce/membership-sites" target="_blank">Member Areas</a> is seamless solution to create membership sites. But I felt the pricing is a bit too expensive cause if you need 

- multiple pricing tier 
- give option to pay monthly or anually for the same tier

you need to upgrade your plan from $10 to $20 🙁.
